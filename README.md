# Portfolio Project

## Welcome to my first GitHub project!

This is my initial repository on GitHub, and I am excited to share my work with the community.

In this project, you will find:

- Two HTML files. In the second file, you'll find a brief JavaScript code that allowed me to link the two web pages and create a small interaction.
- A CSS file containing all the styles.
- Lastly, there's a file with all the resources needed for styling.

Feel free to explore the code and resources. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for checking out my project!
